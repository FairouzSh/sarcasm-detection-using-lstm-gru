 
## Deep Learning to detect sarcasm from new headlines  


* Dataset is collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection)

* Recurrent Neural Network Models (LSTM and GRU) have been trained using Word2Vec and Glove Embeddings

* use [pipreqnb](https://pypi.org/project/pipreqsnb/#:~:text=This%20is%20a%20very%20simple,python%20files%20and%20jupyter%20notebooks.) to generate requirements.txt
